### A homemade Atari clone computer based on Motorola 68060

![Alt text](hw/raven/a0/images/raven_a0.jpg?raw=true "")

This computer is primarily designed to be an Atari clone computer with
the goal of being able to natively run clean GEM/TOS applications.
The machine is fast enough to run hardware-hitting Atari ST games through partial
software emulation.


Disclaimer: I am not an elecrical engineer and I've designed this computer primarily as a one-off for myself.
I'm sure these things are reflected in the design compared to if someone would have made something like this as a product.

Hardware and software sources are provided as-is and free of charge but I cannot make any guarantees or provide much in terms of support.
This thread on the Exxos forums is the build log of my machine: https://www.exxosforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=6940

Do not expect this to be a finished and polished end-user product. The software side and driver support is very much a work in progress.
In fact, I can only in good conscience recommend building one of these if you are someone who likes tinkering with hardware and enjoy a bit of low level programming.

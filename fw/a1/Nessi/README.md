# Nessi : Main bus logic

- nessi.pld
    - current wip

- nessi_240805.pld
    - Timing fixes, especially fixes for 1x CPU mode (48/48mhz).

- nessi_240705.pld
    - first and very timing dependent version and only suitable for 96/48 mhz, possibly 50/25.
Saved because it was used and tested for quite some time during A0 and A1 development.

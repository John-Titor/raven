# Raven ROM

This is all early temporary stuff and a bit all over the place at the moment.

## Todo:
Either make a nice and clear separation on what goes in the bootblock and what goes in EmuTOS, or just build everything into EmuTOS. Also consider MagiC port and avoid having to copy/paste/maintain the same type of code in multiple places.


## Build complete rom including TOS

- Run "make"
- Program rom simm with "rom_tos.bin"


## Build rom with only debug monitor

- Run "make mon"
- Program rom simm with "rom_mon.bin"
